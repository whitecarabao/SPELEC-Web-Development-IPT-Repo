# SPELEC[ ] - WebDev - IPT Repository

This is where all of Daryll's WebDev stuff goes.

## Installation



```bash
You will need to use Composer to initialize your libraries.
```

## Usage
Assuming you loaded Composer into the Project Folder after cloning...
```
php composer.phar update
```
This will pull necessary libraries in a snap - no more including GCP Auth Libs in the Repo!
## Contributing
This is a personal project for academic purposes.
Group works may be appended here.
